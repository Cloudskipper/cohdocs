Repo for CoH i25/24 Docs
------------------------------

PDFS
------------------------------
PDFs are converted schemas with information on each indvidual column.

They are available individually in the folder OR as a zip for convenience.

**USE THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**



GM Commands
-----------------------------
This contains a text file of GM Server-sided commands and their required access levels to use.

Could help if you need GMs (or higher-level GMs) but not Admins.

As far as I can tell, there is currently no way to edit which level has access to which commands(to make your own GMs, for instance).



Other Files
----------------------------
**cebsnar.txt**

As far as I can tell, this is being used by the server, so make sure to place it back into the dir it came from **(\data\texts\English)**

Add words here you want censored from chat by the client when "Filter Profanity" is on. Or leave them out. Funny read anyway.

**title.def, v_title.def, p_title.def, i_titles.def**

These files determine the available titles for players to choose from, by origin. 

Title = Heroes

V Title = Villians

P Title = Prae

I Title = Incarnate?

These files also need to be placed in the right dir **(\data\texts\English)**



**Other files will be added to this Repo as I find them, if they're useful.**
